# Joels Movie Website

This is a project I am coding to complete my Full Stack Nanodegree from udacity.com.
It will:
-Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
-Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.


## Download and Save

Create a folder on our PC and save these all of these files to it from my github repository:
https://github.com/jm2826/Joels-Movie-Website

## Install

Install - Version 2.7.15 from https://www.python.org/

## Quickstart
* On your PC, search for python(IDLE) and open.
* In IDLE, open the file `main_code.py` from the folder you saved the files from the before mentioned github repository.
* Run the `main_code.py` file in IDLE, click on a movie image, and enjoy!
